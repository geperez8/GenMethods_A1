          About Me
        </h2>
        <p>
          Hello, I am a college student who takes pictures for fun. Most of my images focus on landscapes and environments. My work isn't very abstract; they are simply places that have formed naturally or have been created by humans, which is true for most of my pictures. I am very fond of nature and enjoy seeing it in its rawest form. Most of my images have been taken in San Francisco, Denver, and Chicago. My most recent work has been in San Francisco, which is why the quality is drastically better. Feel free to use any of the pictures; I have no problem with that.

          <img class="photo-taken-3" src="https://i.imgur.com/xCKmf0h.jpg" alt="Pigeons are something I tend to take a picture of. This is mainly because they're not afraid of humans, so they're the perfect subject"/>

          <img class="photo-taken-1" src="https://i.imgur.com/4LS6x5b.jpg" alt="This has become one of my all time favorite pictures. The green is very vibrant and the bird is very dark. The contrast is something I really enjoy from this picture."/>
          <img class="photo-taken-1" src="https://i.imgur.com/OLn4R0c.jpg" alt="This is a picture I took from the Golden Gate Bridge. It was honestly an amazing view. I was luckily able to take this even though it was really foggy that day."/>

          <img class="photo-taken-1" src="https://i.imgur.com/lsqopzZ.jpg" alt="This picture was amazing to me. If you look closely, you can see the droplets falling from the feathers of the goose."/>
          <img class="photo-taken-2" src="https://i.imgur.com/tRvErMM.jpg" alt="This picture is just of some trees. I enjoyed seeing the clear sky with the dark green trees. The contrast looks splendid."/>
          <img class="photo-taken-3" src="https://i.imgur.com/beNwkKH.jpg" alt="This picture gives me a warm feeling. The washed down wood and light sky makes me feel at home and welcome."/>

          <img class="photo-taken-2" src="https://i.imgur.com/yHzS2XN.jpg" alt="This image is also one that makes me feel at home. It has a lot of vibrant colors and a beautiful building that peeks through."/>
          <img class="photo-taken-3" src="https://i.imgur.com/M76Sfd9.jpg" alt="This picture is of the side of a hill. I was astonished to see the steepness of it and the sediments there."/>
          <img class="photo-taken-2" src="https://i.imgur.com/nW9KyVy.jpg" alt="This is a far away picture of the rock pictured before. I just enjoy that the rock still manages to be the focus of attention despite the beautiful sea and greenery."/>
          <img class="photo-taken-1" src="https://i.imgur.com/tWHUbuB.jpg" alt="This rock reminded me of the bigger one pictured before. The main difference is that this one is smaller in size and holds fewer birds."/>
          <img class="photo-taken-1" src="https://i.imgur.com/HaBMpz9.jpg" alt="This was one of the few pictures I took of the Golden Gate Bridge. Throughout my stay in San Francisco, it was never foggy at the bridge."/>
